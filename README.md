# Welcome!ðŸ‘‹ 
Iâ€™m a UX designer and linguist, working towards learning about accessibility beyond the text level.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in design, accessibility, modding.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working with Java and Javascript/HTML/CSS. I also know Python.
- ðŸ’ª WIPs: personal website - DONE!!!
- âœ¨ Current obsessions: my sketchbook, variant sudoku, Taskmaster and the indie web
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have completed more than a dozen sketchbooks, some of them made by myself.
